# Charging Dock V3

Hello! This is the Github Repo for the Charging Dock V3, built for PicoVR. 
The case and PCB were designed by me (Abillow.)

This repo will contain all files for the charging dock.

> As of 4/16/2025 this is untested and still needs to be tested. The tracker cases are changing along with their diementions. This will cause issues and the design of the dock will need to be modified in order to adapt to the new case design.
> Build instructions are yet to be made.

Anyone is free to modify this, however, you must apply the same CC lisense to the work and accredit me. I highly reccommend making a fork for it. Thank you.
